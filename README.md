# Birthday Celebration Website

This project is a surprise birthday celebration website dedicated to my mother. It features a scrolling animation that reveals images as the user scrolls down, along with a heartfelt message and a decorative SVG.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the website, including the scrolling animation and main content.
- `css/styles.css`: Contains the styles for the website, including layout, responsive design, and animation effects.
- `js/script.js`: Intended for future JavaScript functionality and interactive features.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```
   cd birthday-celebration-website
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser**:
   You can simply double-click the `index.html` file or open it using your preferred web browser.

## Features

- **Scrolling Animation**: Images are revealed as you scroll down the page, creating an engaging experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive and looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Future Enhancements

The `js/script.js` file is currently empty but can be used to add interactive features or additional animations in the future.
